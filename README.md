# Overview
Bob (BelcherBot was to be quite frank, too weird for my liking) is a new, simple moderation system that streamlines everything that users need, whether it would be roles, moderation, weather, or any of the 8 million other commands that the Discord API allows. Instead of having YAGPDB for moderation, Mee6 for levels, and FredBoat for music, Bob will control everything that falls under that umbrella.

## Feature Set
Bob's skillset for right now will be simple, once we can implement the moderation system into it, then advancement can continue.

2. Rudimentary moderation commands (banning, kicking)
